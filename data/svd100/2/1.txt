I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar.

I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.

I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide.

My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.

I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.

I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause.

It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.

I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)

Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.

In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA

The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It’s always in the hair and skin care area for African American’s. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I’ve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I’m not supposed to! I’m not an old man! 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don’t have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don’t know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream “I give up!”
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don’t understand what is going on
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I’m interested in. Didn’t care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it’s all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
It’s an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don’t have much experience with the drug, so I won’t pass judgement on whether it’s a good or bad take on the issue.

But there’s a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I’ll paraphrase, because I can’t remember word-for-word: 

“It was like my skin was on fire. The brain… uh… fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.” 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it’s benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause….
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he’s being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can’t seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
