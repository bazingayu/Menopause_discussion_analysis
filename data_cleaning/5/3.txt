I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?

Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?

Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol

This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting.

I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?

Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.

I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps.
