I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.

I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.

I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.

Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on

This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs.

For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt.

This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs.

I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.

Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
