Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me.

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.

I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting.

It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.

Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role.

Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!

The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?

Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.

I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better.

I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.

Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t.

Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i’ve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or sautéed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I’ve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn’t seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I’m afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I’ve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I’m beside myself with sadness. I don’t even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don’t want to love like this.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.
