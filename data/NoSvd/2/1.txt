**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.

I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.

Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities

around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned.

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned.

Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.

In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!

Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out.

It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions.

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool.

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins.

Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!

So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.

I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.

I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.

Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?

About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days.

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.

Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.

For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you üëå

I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
