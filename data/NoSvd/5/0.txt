Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal?

My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon.

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x

I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?

I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x

Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
I‚Äôm on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They‚Äôre sending replacements but I‚Äôm supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It‚Äôs my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
