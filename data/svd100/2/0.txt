**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I‚Äôm still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
