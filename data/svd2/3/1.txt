**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven’t bled other than light spotting ever since. I’m 48 and full on peri but how do I know it’s been a full year without a period when I don’t have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don’t know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven’t had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it’s coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven’t had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5’9, so it’s not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It’s not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself 😅
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren’t able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn’t concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don’t have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn’t properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it’s of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I’m 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It’s making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can’t concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I’m taking biotin and …the other one (brain fart). I don’t color it. I wash it twice a week. It’s not thinning. I’m on HRT. Any suggestions?
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I’ve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I’ve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I’ve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I’m impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can’t bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I’m 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I’ve gained 25 lbs — yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I’m pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I’m in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I’m technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I’ve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I’m still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I’m interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I’d love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I’m holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
