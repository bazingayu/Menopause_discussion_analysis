Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. 🫶
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
Just wanted to share with you - it’s big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was “early” &amp; can’t start before the age of 42.
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a “cure” for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn’t. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought “Eureka, I’m done”… until I wasn’t. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that’s the first thing I’m requesting. I’ve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I’m going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I’m hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I’m wondering when you’re on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I’m so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I’m 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I’ve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I’m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I’m trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn’t correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It’s been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Hello — I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I’m using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It’s been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be “Yay!” But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad 😕)

It’s been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I’ve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I’m hormonal, haven’t slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don’t necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible — “I’ve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!”
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn’t beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I’ve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don’t like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I’m going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn’t have 40 years ago. I don’t have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women’s youth and men’s wisdom with age, so screw the media I’m doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I’ve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it’s hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I’ve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I’m on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn’t sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I’m back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I’m seeing my GP next week, but maybe I’m just looking for a little bit of hope. I’d appreciate your experiences (but please please don’t suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don’t know how to go on. Just need to know I’m not alone. This change really sucks!
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I’m in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don’t know how I’m meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I’ve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I’ve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I’ve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I’d have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I’d sleep “better.” But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don’t know how I’m supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I’ve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don’t know how I’m going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be “on” from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don’t work I don’t get paid and then I can’t pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren’t supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don’t eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y’all wait in between these pills?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn’t giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT’s. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I’m dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can’t with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I’m just exhausted. I’m in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I’m just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I’m beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things…cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I’d had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I’m 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It’s taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I’ve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I’ve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I’ve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it’s definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and…I can feel actual *joy* again 💃💃💃This is truly the best part. I’d totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you’re scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won’t work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I’d encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength 💜🌺💪
I don’t mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren’t as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I’ve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting…a little heavier …then by Valentine’s Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway…it’s still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it’s on the way out. 
I know I’m super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I’m really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now…to get to my question 😜  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I’m asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what’s to come Tuesday. I’m just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? 🙏
