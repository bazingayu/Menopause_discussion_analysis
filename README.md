# Nenopause discussion Analysis
The loss of hormones during menopause is a difficult stage of life that has both physical and psychological effects that might interfere with day-to-day activities. As technology is on the rise, social media
platforms and forums can give useful knowledge and social support to people going through menopause,
even though medical experts might not always be suited to do so. The study here aims to verify the
hypothesis that increased engagement on social media platforms among women undergoing menopause
and other section of people have led to enhanced awareness, better access to accurate information, and
better support networks which leads to more effective management and coping strategies, both physically and mentally, for women suffering from menopausal symptoms.  

To explore this hypothesis, the study will analyze discussions around search terms related to menopause support and interaction from
Twitter and Reddit, as well as identify language usage variations based on gender, menopausal status,
and other clusters using K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. The study
may contribute to a better knowledge of support for people going through menopause by illuminating
the terminology used to address menopause in various contexts.
