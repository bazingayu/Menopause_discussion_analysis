**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that.

But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.

Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones.

That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.

Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions.

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon.

I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.

I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?

My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.

I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life.

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon.

I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world.

I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. 🙄

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
There are very few books on Storytel in my native language. Do you have anything that you recommend there?

I'm searching for something that covers every aspect of peri and hopefully also some ideas on how to fix symptoms that won't go even on hormones. 
Also if that book includes ADHD and menopause that would be BRILLIANT.
Thank you 👌

Edit í removed the link cuz it didn't work 🤦‍♀️
I was prescribed .5 estradot about 6 months ago and I have noticed that when I use .5 I can sleep, I have an interest in life, no fatigue and my night sweats go completely away. 

But, I think it might make me an emotional wreck. I get really upset and angry over trivial things. I tried cutting my patch in half a couple months ago which seems to help emotionally, but then my night sweats come back and I get so tired and have no interest in life or motivation to do things. 

This week I decided to try .5 again and felt great the first day, was in a great mood, had energy, night sweats gone again. But by the third day a small misunderstanding at work had me so upset I was beside myself. I took the patch off I was so desperate to stop feeling angry about something so small.

Does this happen to anyone else when they increase their estrogen dosage? I’m still not sure if it might just be a coincidence or if the increase can really have that big of an effect on my emotions.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.
Please review our Rules (on the sidebar) and have a read through our Wiki for basic information about the stages of menopause, navigating your first doctor's appointment, hormones, vitamins, and links to some great resources and studies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

PS: any seasoned menopositive folk want to contribute to this guide? Post in the comments and I'll update this 'guide'.  Thanks everyone!
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative.

4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.

Anyone else feel like they are failing at work? The memory loss and brain fog are making it so difficult for me to focus and get things done. My job requires attention to details and lately that seems to be the thing I just cannot do. I have thought about taking a year off because I am just not sure how else to handle this. Anyone else struggling with this? I work with other women who I am sure are in the perimenopause/menopause stage and yet I feel like I am the only one dealing with this.
Those of you on the patches - do you cover them up in the sunshine? Living in England, my lower abdomen rarely sees the sun, but I'm travelling abroad later this year and was wondering where I would put my patch during sunbathing, swimming, etc. They just fall off if I put them on my bottom.

**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I’m not sure what it is, lack of sleep? Life?
Has anyone who has used the combined patch had any improvements  in blood pressure and blood sugar?
I've been having this feeling of pressure in my lower abdomen for about a week. Went to the doctor and tests for UTI and BV both came back negative. Doctor prescribed me an antibiotic for the UTI in case it's a false negative. Last night this pressure navigated to the area of where my left ovary is. I'm on day three of the antibiotics and still have the pressure. I haven't been to my GYN since the follow-up appointment after my hysterectomy (2019). Silly me thought since most of my parts are gone I didn't need to unless I had an issue. I know it's potentially a long shot, but does anyone have any insight on what this feeling could be? Could this be my leftover ovary quitting?
I’m on a 0.075 dosage but my patches did not arrive in the mail this week. They’re sending replacements but I’m supposed to change the patch today. I have unused 0.05 patches from before. If I miss a dose, bad things happen to my mood. It’s my birthday so I would rather not crash into despair today! What would you do in my shoes to compensate before the correct patches arrive? 

1. Use one 0.05 patch (too little)
2. Use two 0.05 patches (too much)
3. Use one new 0.05 patch and keep the old 0.075 patch on (does it still have anything in it?)
4. This is not recommended, but: use 1 0.05 patch and cut another in half to approximate the 0.075 dosage.
Anyone else get the gunk that builds up and is left behind on the edges of their estrogen patch? I also get a small rash (dry skin? Reaction to the adhesive?) from them. I change mine every 3.5 days. 

These are relatively minor issues considering the patch otherwise works amazing for me but I am sick of always having marks all over my butt. 

Any tips?
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
