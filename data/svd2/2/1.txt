I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
I cant decide if its me or general food production but, i‚Äôve become super sensitive to certain flavors.  If there is cheese powder on a potato chip or something fried or saut√©ed in certain oils, it tastes horrible to me.  I‚Äôve never liked cilantro but now I cant even stand the smell.  is it me, food processing or the meno?!
On the bright side, did not burn the house down and the Air BnB guests we met were super lovely.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
This song really resonates with me tonight.... Currently seeking solitude in the tub, collecting my thoughts. I have found great support from this group and all you lovely ladies. Mainly from reading, with the odd addition to conversations. I suppose this is really a party to say thank you! At this is one of the very few places I know my thoughts and actions are understood. ü´∂
Ex. I am currently on Bijuva - 100mg progesterone + 1mg estradiol
AND vaginal estrogen suppositories 0,03mg

I feel like the amounts are too low.
So I had an ablation about 15 years ago and haven‚Äôt bled other than light spotting ever since. I‚Äôm 48 and full on peri but how do I know it‚Äôs been a full year without a period when I don‚Äôt have periods? I would still get period symptoms some but now I have so many peri symptoms I don‚Äôt know the difference. Has anyone else that had an ablation figured out when you actually hit menopause?
Just wanted to share with you - it‚Äôs big news over in the UK and it is quite disgusting that the police would release such information. 

Luckily, it is being called out for the sexist garbage it is.

Sorry for the Daily Mail (trash paper) link, but it covers the situation well:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11762577/Police-release-Nicola-Bulleys-personal-struggles-menopause-sexist-comes.html

Also stating her peri menopause was ‚Äúearly‚Äù &amp; can‚Äôt start before the age of 42.
For the last few months. Sex is all I‚Äôm interested in. Didn‚Äôt care less about it the last 5 years, yet now it‚Äôs all I want! Is this the beginning of the end! (Me: 45)
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
Please share any hair care tips for hair falling out. I don't want to start HRT yet (only willing to start after 12 months with no period). 4 months no period. Had a period now. Diagnosed as POI. Either way I'm definitely in the throes of perimenopause. 40 years old. My hair is definitely falling out more than normal. What non HRT tips can anyone share for saving my hair?
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
It‚Äôs an interesting doc, mostly just personal accounts of how benzodiazepines have helped and hurt people. I don‚Äôt have much experience with the drug, so I won‚Äôt pass judgement on whether it‚Äôs a good or bad take on the issue.

But there‚Äôs a man interviewed who is dealing with a lifelong Xanax prescription, and when he tried to reduce his dosage, his body goes haywire. I‚Äôll paraphrase, because I can‚Äôt remember word-for-word: 

‚ÄúIt was like my skin was on fire. The brain‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ fog, horrible fog, sounds and smells were overwhelming. Heart palpitations, horrible fatigue.‚Äù 

Huh. Sounds familiar. 

(There is also a comment early in the doc by one of the practitioners about how menopause is so overwhelming and women of that age were the most common users of anti-anxieties drugs).
Sooo, I thought I had finally found a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for my hot flashes. After trying several supplements over several months, me-no-pause by womaness actually worked! Until it didn‚Äôt. I also rubbed a bit of clary sage on the soles of my feet and I thought ‚ÄúEureka, I‚Äôm done‚Äù‚Ä¶ until I wasn‚Äôt. None of my former gynecologists take my current insurance, I finally found one that does but I need a referral, so when I see my primary in a few weeks, that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm requesting. I‚Äôve been on testosterone pellets in the past as well as progesterone. I‚Äôm going to avoid the testosterone (too many side affects for me) this time but I‚Äôm hoping to get an estrogen cream. I want as little as possible just to get some relief. I‚Äôm wondering when you‚Äôre on the cream do you take progesterone as well and if so is it always in pill form or can that also be in a cream form? I‚Äôm so looking forward to sleeping through the night again.
Was anyone else prescribed ADHD meds? Just curious.

The TL;DR version is that when my peri symptoms became unmanageable and I sought medical treatment, the untreated ADHD I already figured I had was diagnosed and I took the pills because I was desperate (and because it was the only treatment I was offered.) Adderall helps the brain fog to a certain extent and I was just curious if anyone else experienced anything similar.
I just got the merina IUD yesterday . I‚Äôm 49 and had like 6 weeks of heavy bleeding. I had a weird sleep last night, dreams, naseau, but today I feel good. I‚Äôve got light bleeding/spotting but nothing like I was suffering with for the last 6 weeks.  Is there any thing I should know or be doing or watching for with my new IUD?
For the past two periods I have had cramps which I haven‚Äôt had in years. Just got my period yesterday and this time I am dealing with extreme pain which feels like it‚Äôs coming from my right ovary. I turn 51 in two weeks but still bleeding every 28 days. 

Could this new kind of pain during my period mean I have late onset endometriosis or just a bad ovarian cyst that becomes painful during my period? Ibuprofen had barely helped. 

I will be calling my doctor on Monday, but just wondering if this happened to anyone else?
So I haven‚Äôt had a period since around the New Year.  It was initially heavy for a week and then I bled slightly for another two weeks.  My hormones did something crazy because I came unhinged and got extremely depressed for a couple weeks.

Oh, and I gained about 10 pounds in a month.  That is concerning.  I was underweight at 118 lbs, 5‚Äô9, so it‚Äôs not the end of the world.  Just concerning it got put on so fast.  Water weight gain?  Not on any meds.  My activity was pretty low and I had PMS hunger symptoms and ate what I wanted but still no period to this day.

Where do I go from here?  Do I get hormones tested?  Should I be looking into HRT?  It‚Äôs not just the weight gain, absence of period but the emotional wreck I am right now.  How to navigate this?

Im focusing on daily walks (10k steps), swimming and yoga for exercise.  Committing to cutting out sugar and carbs.  Im 49, single and not looking to get into any relationship right now as I am enough for myself üòÖ
around 2 years ago, I was 30F and had an AMH of 3.01 and normal thyroid functioning but the doctor mentioned something about how they weren‚Äôt able to properly count the egg reserve in ultrasound (which he mentioned was low) but since I had high AMH he wasn‚Äôt concerned. I have had multiple early pregnancy losses and my PMS has almost turned into PMDD after my 3rd pregnancy loss due to trauma/anxiety. for reference my mom had her menopause at 42 (however she said she has been having regular yet light period after turning 32). I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like hot flashes/night sweats but have been having dryness/insomnia during luteal phase. what are my chances of being in perimenopause right now? also how can I have higher AMH yet lower count of egg reserve? is it possible that the ultrasound wasn‚Äôt properly performed? (I have a retroverted uterus, if it‚Äôs of any concern).. please let me know what could be happening here.. I am very concerned.. I have no living kids..
I was reading comments on here from so many people who cannot really tolerate alcohol well anymore. Is there anyone who is able to drink alcohol and feel okay?
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  I‚Äôm so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
Suffering with horrible flashes and anxiety among other things. Estrogel alone improving symptoms but doctor just added norethidrone. Wants me to stay on only one pump of gel too is that typical ? Thank you so much for any thoughts or advice.
I'm on HRT. My general doctor thinks IUD may be at odds with my HRT. I've had a love hate relationship with mirena--so much breast soreness and I was never crazy about hormonal birth control. Anyone else get rid of IUD and it actually help?
My long awaited with my NAMS Gyn appointment resulted in nothing but an SSRI script, just like my Primary care Dr.  

So I am moving onto Telehealth in search of HRT.  I like that MIDI takes insurance, has anyone used them?

I will take other telehealth recommendations too!  I need something to change because my life is going to shit.
My symptoms are under control, I think, but an issue has come up, which may be  due to peri, who knows.  I use Evoral patches in 100mg and Utrogestan tablets.  I am feeling pretty good on this combo.  

I do sometimes find myself trying to work out if I have gotten confused and misremembered events.  This usually stems by my husband telling me I‚Äôm trying to gaslight him &amp; I only back down when he calls me out.  This isn‚Äôt correct, I genuinely believe that I have the situation straight in my head but he gets so upset I start doubting myself and accept I may be wrong after all.  

It‚Äôs been happening more frequently in recent months and after it happened yet again this week I am thinking I need to consider that I am unintentionally gaslighting after all.

I am coming here to see if anyone else has been in a similar situation?  Just trying to work out if I need therapy or a reassessment of my HRT.  Maybe both?  Feeling rather lost and in need of some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
I am a 49 yr old female and recently had irregular spotting (extremely light, one or two drops a day if that) for several weeks after my last period. Went to gyn, she did pap and checked for infection. Also scheduled a T/V Ultrasound. No infections, pap was fine. 

During my ultrasound, tech asked if I had a uterine ablation. She had difficulty getting a good image. Got a call this week that everything looked normal, but it was hard to assess the image of my uterus so they scheduled an endometrial biopsy. 

I honestly thought this was just a long goodbye from my period as I am very much in perimenopause, but now I am worried. Anyone have this happen or know what would make it difficult to see my uterus?
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
I recently had an hysterectomy, so I was forced to be in Menopause for cancer related purposes.  But  I was told that since I removed the whole thing, I need to get Zometa shots every 6 months. Does anyone has any experiences with this Zometa  shots willing to share here?
Hello ‚Äî I am picking up a new prescription today for compounded cream for vaginal use to fight atrophy and dryness. It is 2% hiyaluronic acid and 1mg estriol. The pharmacist said it is about 5 times as powerful as the .01% estradiol cream I‚Äôm using now. Does anyone have experience with this specific combination?
It‚Äôs been a week since I decided to give up alcohol and I should be ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù But I feel horribly. (And then feel bad about feeling bad üòï)

It‚Äôs been a month since my doc took me off my birth control so they could check my hormones and thyroid. (Blood tests are on Monday). Since I was already feeling crappy, I figured it would be a good time to give up the drinking habits I‚Äôve developed, especially over Covid. 

So I‚Äôm hormonal, haven‚Äôt slept more than a few hours a night since I stopped drinking and am just feeling really down emotionally and physically. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel like drinking but I just need some possible ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there. It gets better. Keep going!!‚Äù
I learned about this cycle as a child and now understand that I need to redefine what it means to me. Wisdom or wrinkles, knowledge or aches, and can I reject the old ideas that age isn‚Äôt beautiful. To be at the point in perimenopause where a mid life crisis is here can be my supper power I‚Äôve decided. I get to perceive it all as I chose and if I don‚Äôt like my perceptions I can change them. I used to perceive the crone as old and wrinkly, but now I think I‚Äôm going to redefine that. Wisdom, knowledge, experience, and maturity do not have to be in wrinkles as I have options to age gracefully and dye my hair now days. Thank God for the internet, supplements, yoga, and all the tools I have that my mother didn‚Äôt have 40 years ago. I don‚Äôt have to be miserable to go through this stage in life.   
The media worships women‚Äôs youth and men‚Äôs wisdom with age, so screw the media I‚Äôm doing my own thing. 
Hi all.  I‚Äôve had debilitating insomnia for 20 years now, it‚Äôs hell. Lingering symptom of complex PTSD.  I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything, nothing helps me longer than about 3 weeks.  I‚Äôm on an antidepressant that appears to do very little.
My GP prescribed the above to me 2 weeks ago. It had an instant effect. I slept brilliantly, had some energy, and started to feel I could make plans.  Until one night I didn‚Äôt sleep. And then the next, and so on. The disappointment is immense and I‚Äôm back to pointless zombie life,  with  the dark thoughts that accompany it.
Is this likely to be just a blip while my body gets used to the HRT, and should I stick at it? I‚Äôm seeing my GP next week, but maybe I‚Äôm just looking for a little bit of hope. I‚Äôd appreciate your experiences (but please please don‚Äôt suggest camomile tea etc!). Thank you x
I‚Äôm 52. Peri symptoms started more than a year ago. Nothing severe, this thread helped me a lot. Suddenly significant brain fog, body aches and some fatigue.  The brain fog is scary. It‚Äôs making my ADHD so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts in managing ADHD through peri and menopause?   It can‚Äôt concentrate enough to do my job. I am on medication for my ADHD.  I need to start journaling my symptoms What health journaling app do you use? Tks
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
Just need to vent. I am so sleep deprived from broken sleep and insomnia. Some days I don‚Äôt know how to go on. Just need to know I‚Äôm not alone. This change really sucks!
I have no joy in my life and am soooo angry all the time: 
Go an appt with my GP on Tuesday. 
Would I need to go through the whole blood test route, or due to my age could I just be offered medication? TIA
Recently I have been looking for a  something different  to drink since I only drink coffee, fresh brewed tea and lots water. I figured I would give sparkling mineral water a try but I have many food allergies so I wanted something flavor free.  In researching the best mineral waters to drink I came across an article about the benefits. I was shocked at how many times the article mentioned post menopausal women and it‚Äôs benefits.  I thought I would share it here.
Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
Or at best, an inch every 4 months. I‚Äôm taking biotin and ‚Ä¶the other one (brain fart). I don‚Äôt color it. I wash it twice a week. It‚Äôs not thinning. I‚Äôm on HRT. Any suggestions?
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I‚Äôm in so much pain from cramps and sciatica pain and not sleeping I want to cry. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm meant to keep functioning. 

Went 5 months without a period. Started hrt (continuous progesterone and estradiol patches) and then had one. My Gyn NP freaked out and told me I might have cancer right before Christmas and took me off estrogen. Ultrasound and biopsy after Christmas said I was fine. Estrogen restarted at 4x previous amount. I‚Äôve now had 4 periods in 5 weeks. Keep having bad cramps. 

Add onto this I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I basically keep waking up because I stop breathing. And then I can‚Äôt get back to sleep. And I wake up with headaches all the time. I get so sleepy during the day I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on the drive to work. I‚Äôve got another sleep study scheduled this week where they will determine settings for my CPAP. Then I have to wait for my machine to arrive. 

I am just miserable. Usually I‚Äôd have really poor sleep for maybe 2 days in a row and then I‚Äôd sleep ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù But this is going on 5 days in a row of barely sleeping. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to function anymore. I just want to cry. 

I got fed up with the NP and found a Gyn listed with NAMS and saw her a few weeks ago. She wanted to give it a few more weeks to see how I reacted to the increase in estradiol and get the results of my sleep study. I‚Äôve got a follow up scheduled in 10 days. 

Has anyone else had an excessive amount of periods when increasing estradiol? Excessive amount of cramps? Anyone else with sleep apnea? 

Monday is my busiest day and I frankly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the day. I teach private music lessons and have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù from 3-9 with zero breaks. If I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt get paid and then I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage. I feel like I am in hell.
I'm approximately 7 months from my last full-ish period and in the last week have had several days of light spotting.

I coincidentally had a check in with the Women's Health specialist this week and mentioned it. She says there should be no bleeding at all after 6 months on HRT and I've been on it for over 12 months.

I now have to go in for a pelvic ultrasound because she is concerned about the risk if uterine cancer (family history of uterine and breast cancer and personal history of thyroid cancer).

I did not need this in my current to do list.
So, I was supposed to see Ant-Man yesterday. I walked to the theater, is really calm weather. As I was crossing a street SVT hit me. I got into the theater, got some water had them call 9-1-1(since it was a HR over 150 for over 5 mins resting). I got taken by Ambulance to an ER (Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, Ca if you are local you'll know it) the paramedic had me hooked up to leads and kept an eye on my HR as it kept falling closer to normal. He advised that I would be find(was VERY comforting and empathetic) and said he had adenosine ready to go if needed, and explained what it is/does(I know 2 folks who have had it). I made it to Huntington, was brought it and turned over to the staff.  
The staff ran all the normal tests I've had before(screen for heart attack, clots etc) but in a HUGE change from Kaiser they told me AS they were doing the tests, what we were testing for and what to expect.  
After all the tests the Doc came in and took a full history of my SVT, and was sympathetic. SHe was FLOORED that I had never seen a cardiologist. I have had multiple cardiac tests(holter test, echocardiogram etc), but all the info/results were sent thru my Primary doc.  I don't even know my cardiologist's name,  just know "he's one of the best". My ER doc, was very firm that I need to get Kaiser to assign me not only a Cardiologist that I have a relationship wth, but also I need an electrophysiologist(and explained what that type of doc does). The doc was horrified that I have not been screen by one yet and have ONLY been treated with medication.   


Being on HRT has seemingly spread the attacks out(my last one was in November), but as they are still happening, we need to revisit other treatments.  


I \*KNOW\* this is off-topic, as it's not directly related to Menopause that  I know of , but I need help on how to navigate within KP until my husband and I are able to switch to something else when his company has open enrollment. ANY assistance or advise is helpful.
I color my hair every 5 to 6 weeks because of my gray roots. I tend to alternate between getting highlights and getting just root color done, because the highlights tend to get brassy.  

I just noticed in some old pictures of me, that my hair was so shiny in my 30s. It was darker, but even when I had highlights, the rest of my hair with shiny. Nothing about my hair now is shiny. 

Is this just something we have to accept with old age? Is it caused by dying the gray hair?
The flu hit me on Saturday out of no where.  No ramping up just immediate incessant productive cough, chills, aches, etc.  So while this kept me up all night it would have been nice if the hot flashes had given me a break and not keep waking me up also.

I called in sick as I can't go more than a few minutes without hacking up a lung, so now I feel guilty about that.  Just whining, it's hard to separate the fever/chills from the flu from my usual hot/cold flashes.
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Any tips for weight loss during perimenopause‚Ä¶.
Is it even possible? Also is it normal for the belly to be round up too too?  Like pregnant belly?
Sorry if this has already been asked (I assume it has on numerous occasions) but "the" is too generic a word and I tried a variety of combinations but only found explanations of the menopausal transition / menopause.

With "the menopause" being mentioned abundantly in the news currently, and to my ears it sounds weird, I'd like to understand why the process is / has to be prefixed with "the". 

Is it a contextual requirement? 
Is this a language rule?
Are there caes where "the" is not prefixed?

Thanks in advance.
Hi friends! I had COVID two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been on HRT since August, have not bled or had the PMS-y menopause symptoms since September. During my bout with COVID
I started bleeding again, and I‚Äôve been spotting on and off ever since - with sore breasts, bloating, food cravings and crankiness, everything I went on HRT for. 

Any insight, experience or advice?
Sorry about the title.  If you are happy and you know it just randomly popped into my head as I was typing that.    

Just wanted to let others know you are not alone.   I actually have my husband really worried about me at the moment because for some odd reason my brain translates certain phrases he says to me as: he‚Äôs being mean so let the water works fly!   For example:  I guess I annoyed him while he was watching a video today with a couple of questions.  He said:  what is with you and the questions?  (Said in an annoyed tone of voice) and my brain decided that was mean and it needed to let the water works loose.  The other day I snapped at a student because he kept tapping my arm to tell me something.

So yes I am raising my hand as well as clapping them.  I am a emotional mess and I know it but can‚Äôt seem to explain why I am to my poor husband.
Does anyone have experience of a receding hairline (the 2 areas just above the temples) growing back after using HRT?

I‚Äôve been on the proper HRT dose for 7 weeks now and not yet seeing any difference. Maybe I‚Äôm impatient. But still would like to know if anyone did see some growth recovery of this kind of hair loss and how long it took?
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
About to turn 51 and very much still in peri. I have flooding periods that have also gotten extremely painful the last two cycles. I have been dealing with horrible insomnia for a year and a half so doctor prescribed oral progesterone. 100mg nightly did nothing, 200 mg nightly does seem to help a little. Progesterone almost completely cured my urinary leakage which was getting pretty bad. 

I am at the point where I truly can‚Äôt bare the flooding and painful periods anymore. Constant Advil and Tylenol barely helped the pain this time. 

I have been given the options of an ablation or Mirena IUD. I would love an ablation but my mother had all sorts of cancer during her lifetime and I hear that if I am at risk for cancer, it would be hard to do a uterine biopsy after ablation.

So I am left with the Mirena option. I know that will sub in for my  progesterone in HRT so will no longer get the benefits from the oral prog. (I am hoping to start estrogen soon). 

Has anyone gone from oral progesterone to Mirena? How did that effect your sleep?
I haven't had a period in 2 years. So I sought help. I had a hotflash last night and my period. I thought I was past that.  I'm just venting! I will be calling in the morning. Keep up the good fight ladies!!!

Has anyone else been dealing with extreme joint pain while entering Perimenopause? My knees, hips, writs and sometimes ankles are so achy these days. More so than when I was 40. I turned 43 in July 2022. It makes working out difficult because I have to navigate the pain, and do so much more to recover.

What do you ladies do for Joint Pain that‚Äôs an all-natural remedy? Is this normal?
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
Mercifully I have been given new HRT meds (Estradiol &amp; Noreth 1-.05) by my lovely new GYN. But am also on 45mg of NP thyroid and you aren‚Äôt supposed to take them together. I take the NP Thyroid first thing in the morning and don‚Äôt eat or take supplements for an hour.

When should I take the HRT pill? I tried to take it before I went to sleep, but it kept me up for hours. (Maybe I just felt good for the first time in awhile. lol) 

How many hours do y‚Äôall wait in between these pills?
My high arches are aching, even in my beloved Birkenstocks.  What daily wear shoes do ya'all enjoy?
I'm 53 and have fibroids and ovarian cysts. On the advice of my doctor, I had a Mirena IUD inserted 6 years ago to control heavy periods. Although it was due to be replaced over a year ago, I was having menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Estradiol 0.05 mg patches and oral progesterone 200 mg nightly. 

Two months ago, I had the IUD removed at my gynecologist's advice, as he assumed I was on the other side of menopause (hadn't had a period in 5 years from the IUD), and frankly, so did I. 

Two days ago I started bleeding purple blood with small clots mixed in. Shit!

I have menstrual cramps that have kept me in my pj's all darn day. I looked up purple blood and Dr. Google reports that purple menstruation comes from too much estrogen. 

How the heck have I got too much estrogen now? The patch? Do I take it off? 

If you have read this far and have an opinion of what you would do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. If this topic has been covered before, I apologize,  I couldn't find it.
Picture it...Thousand Oaks, August 20th, 2022: a 40 yr old woman with multiple chronic illnesses needs emergency surgery to remove her one lonesome ovary that despite being stapled down twice, decided to twist and die. (Thank you cEDS) 
I was initially put on the highest dose patch there is. 5 months later it stopped working. Switched to the 1mg pill, then doubled the dose 1.5 weeks ago.
Now the port in my chest isn‚Äôt giving blood return and is clotting because of the high dose estrogen. 
D dimer is high. Family history of DVT‚Äôs. 
Now back down to 1mg estrogen pill plus 0.625 of Premarin. 
Was just reading up on Premarin and the increased risk of breast cancer. 
Post-menopausal breast cancer runs in my family. Been getting mammograms since 32.
I already get infusions twice a week, take a million pills, have had every non-life sustaining organ removed from my body, and now I‚Äôm dealing with trying to dodge blood clots and cancer.
I just can‚Äôt with this shit. I won the genetic lottery with having an incurable connective tissue disease, autonomic neuropathy, thyroid disease, and a million other things. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm in an air cast on my right foot trying to avoid surgery and have a partial labrum tear in my right shoulder. What.The.Actual.Fuck. 
I‚Äôm just tired and would love to unzip this faulty body suit and step into one that functions normally. I‚Äôm beyond exhausted.
I am in peri and I am aware that mood swings are a part it. But I seem to have the most extreme mood swings. The week before and during my period I have suicidal thoughts and can barely get out of bed or function , then the week after I have a ton of energy and am almost euphoric. I also get obsessive about things‚Ä¶cleaning, working, organizing etc. I am questioning if these kind of extremes are normal? I have friends who are bipolar and it sounds a lot like what they experience during their depressive and manic episodes. But I also know that there is a direct correlation with my cycle (hormones). Anyone else experience this?
This is a HINT and I am sharing to be helpful. I am white AF and this combo is the only thing keeping my skin supple. It‚Äôs always in the hair and skin care area for African American‚Äôs. There is nothing comparable in the white people area-I have tried them all and they are too watery or too sticky. I once used True Blue Spa Extra Rich Body Cream and it was wonderful but they discontinued it.
I‚Äôm 52 and well into peri. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs ‚Äî yuck! Thinking about the older women in my family (Mom, both grandmothers, both aunts), I‚Äôm pretty sure they all got puffy around 45-55 years old, then slimmed down again after that. I assume I‚Äôm in for a similar ride: weight gain in peri, weight loss in post. Does this ring true for any of you?
I have never had an issue with abnormal ear wax build up. I typically clean my ears once a week after a shower - for those of you opposed to Qtips, you do you. No problems or concerns.

I‚Äôve noticed over time the wax in my right ear is becoming dry and more challenging to remove. Left ear is totally normal. 

This morning my cat scratched the hell out of my ear lobe, climbing on my head as a means to let me know he was starving. I get up and clean the scratches with some peroxide. I decide to put some in my right ear. The amount of bubbling and rumbling in my ear was crazy. My stepdad and husband have this problem. I‚Äôm not supposed to! I‚Äôm not an old man! 

Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this? 

I guess I can be grateful I don‚Äôt have the ear hair to go along with the old man ear wax. I truly don‚Äôt know my body anymore. I want to throw my hands in the air and scream ‚ÄúI give up!‚Äù
All of a sudden my hair looks and feels dry and lack luster.  My scalp can be itchy also.  Don‚Äôt understand what is going on
Hello fellow brave warriors, just wanted to give an update on my HRT journey and hopefully offer a bit of encouragement to others. 

Tl:dr: almost a year of trial &amp; error but finally getting my life back! 

First, I was scared shitless of HRT because I‚Äôd had horrible experiences on the BCP when younger despite trying basically every option out there (I also had PMDD and the BCP just made me super, extra insane). But after getting some encouragement on this sub and basically spiraling into a complete emotional and mental breakdown over the past two years (I‚Äôm 48F) that was literally destroying almost every aspect of my life, I finally surrendered and decided to try HRT.

Found a (wonderful!) meno doc through NAMS in March 2022 and started my HRT journey. It‚Äôs taken almost a year but finally (FINALLY!!!) I feel almost normal/stable again. I‚Äôve also decided, on the advice of the same meno doc and my therapist, to try a low dose of Prozac alongside the HRT.

It was a process for sure. I can say that adding in estrogen had an almost immediate positive effect (esp. on hot flashes, cramping, many of the physical symptoms) but it took about 9 months to get the dosage and delivery method right (I‚Äôve found most success with oral Estradiol after trying gels, vaginal creams/inserts, patches) alongside cycling progesterone (most success with synthetic tablets after trying compounded, the horse pee one, etc.). Have not added testosterone yet but likely going to try the pellets or cream at some point because my sex drive is still in the toilet most of the time. 

Been on a steady HRT dosage for 3 months and my lord, what a difference from a year ago when I was curled on the floor in a ball riddled with anxiety and panic attacks, then in bed for weeks with black depression and SI. I‚Äôve only been on the Prozac for a month and there was also an adjustment period but seems to finally have kicked in and it‚Äôs definitely helping keep me at a stable emotional baseline along with the HRT. I actually feel now like I have a choice in my emotional state and reactions instead of being hijacked and out of control. 

Just started a new job I could have *never* even contemplated a year ago, my marriage is so much better, and I generally just feel like participating in life again after two years of wanting to die or check myself into a psychiatric facility. And, and‚Ä¶I can feel actual *joy* again üíÉüíÉüíÉThis is truly the best part. I‚Äôd totally forgotten what that felt like. 

So if you‚Äôre scared and overwhelmed by the thought of starting HRT and/or are worried it won‚Äôt work because you had awful experiences with the BCP, I‚Äôd encourage you to try. Find a good doc (if anyone here is in the Washington, DC or DMV area, happy to share the name of mine) and accept it may take months of trial and error. But when it finally works? So, so worth it. Sending you all love and strength üíúüå∫üí™
I‚Äôm technically in perimenopause but have gone six months without a period. I‚Äôve actually felt better as I get closer to menopause. Though, I‚Äôm still dead inside, have the occasional hot flashes, sleeplessness, hair loss, and brain fog, I loved the diminished appetite, lack of water retention and easier weight maintenance. Within a couple of days of starting HRT, I was ravenous, and in addition to having gained weight, I wake up with a puffy face. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, did it improve? 

I‚Äôm interested in the protective benefits of HRT but my main concerns are hair loss (I must wear my hair up at this point)and brain fog that is seriously impacting my ability to do high level work and my interest in social activities 
(my poor memory, verbal fluency issues, and unpolished appearance make them tiring and less fun). 

I‚Äôd love to hear if HRT has significantly helped anyone with hair loss or cognitive issues. If so, I can live with a little weight gain for sure. I‚Äôm holding out hope. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
I don‚Äôt mean that you are attracted to women now but, do you feel like you aren‚Äôt as attracted compared with how you used to be?
Age 56. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for a little over a year now for menopause and libido through online clinic. 
I had not had a period for a little over a year before starting HRT. My gyno did not say anything against it at my last annual.  
My mom was diagnosed with Uterine cancer at same age as I am now ,56. She had a full hysterectomy. Also breast cancer stage 2 many years later. No chemo, just pills and she was cleared. 
I had some breakthrough spotting after starting HRT and consulted with clinic but they just said to up progesterone 2 pills to get it under control and then go back down to 1 pill. That seemed to stop spotting. 
Since then we have upped my estrogen a little and lowered testosterone to get my libido dialed in , it worked.  I was feeling really good.
Last month I had some breakthrough spotting again (light bleeding) . 
This month I started with light spotting‚Ä¶a little heavier ‚Ä¶then by Valentine‚Äôs Day I had bleeding. Sometimes just regular bleeding, sometimes thick tar like bleeding. A little clotting. I started taking 2 progesterone pills at night to see if it would stop . 
Anyway‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still going on but easing up. Back to spotting a little now. I think it‚Äôs on the way out. 
I know I‚Äôm super worried. I made appointment with my Gyno for Tuesday.
I‚Äôm really freaking out because of my moms history with uterine cancer.
Also, because everything I read says high estrogen and HRT increase chances.
Now‚Ä¶to get to my question üòú  
Do they do biopsy for uterine cancer testing? Or can I ask for just ultrasound?? 
2 yrs ago I was having some pain and she did biopsy in office (unexpected ) that day and it was very uncomfortable. I would love not to go through that again! 
I guess I‚Äôm asking here In advance of my appointment to get my mind prepped for what‚Äôs to come Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a mess with anxiety over all of this. 
Has anyone had the screening and only had ultrasound? üôè
