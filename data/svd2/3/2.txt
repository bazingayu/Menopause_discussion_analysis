Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing.

First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon.

But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.

Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it.

I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful.

I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.

I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
I'm 50 and perimenopausal and noticing some upsetting trends. I used to be able to eat all the foods. Spicy foods, acidic foods, grains, dried fruit, etc. Now, if I eat so much as a flax seed muffin or a couple of dried apricots, it is like I am blasting nuclear-grade farts for the next day and a half. If I eat anything spicy, or acidic, I get horrific heartburn at night. It's so disappointing! My husband's grandma used to eat only roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bananas and now I totally understand, 

Also, I notice that my PMS is getting worse as I creep closer to menopause. I still have regular cycles, however, the week before I get my period, I feel crazy. It is like a burst of serious depression, anxiety, and anger all rolled into one. Then as soon my period starts, I feel better.

This makes me wonder if "She Sheds" are simply places for perimenopausal/menopausal women to retreat to for episodes of rage crafting and farting?
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
Has anyone been overheating to the point if being too warm 24/7. Then hot flushes on top of that. Your skin is permanently clammy then your body temperature rises up and down like a roller coaster all day and night. I have my window open at night and the duvet half on half off but my body is still too warm.
Is this a spike in estrogen or a drop. Its been going on for 7 years now. I'm perimenopause and 53 and HRT doesn't work.
I am 52 and have been in menopause for about a year. For the last 3 years though I basically have been on some sort of Alternate Day fasting. Though over the last year I have been trying to be less strict.   But I have noticed that now, I just cannot eat normal food every day without pain like I really over did it.  Like 6 days with eating every day leads to pain. 

I have had ultrasounds and Cts recently so I don't think it is anything like a tumor. 

I have heard that as you age your stomach gets less flexible so I am wondering if anyone else has notice an inability to eat as much as you used to?

I would say it is about 20% less.
I know I'm not alone here. I understand that poor sleep and anxiety are very common experiences for the perimenopausal among us. But lately I find that the anxiety I am experiencing in the middle of the night is powerfully bad. I usually go to sleep at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. on a weeknight. I might make it to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., then bam -- I wake up and find myself just a minute or two later to be in the midst of a terrible sense of doom. I don't feel like I am thinking about specific things in my life - though I do have all sorts of things that give me anxiety these days - but I'm just overwhelmed by fear and dread and darkness. It eventually passes and if I'm lucky, I get back to sleep within 30 minutes. If I'm unlucky, it might take two hours to fall back asleep, but I find the anxiety usually wears off over time.

I try to remind myself when I'm awake and going about my day the next morning that it's not all that bad, that it's just something my hormonal imbalance is doing to me. But it's just so scary and awful. 

Do others have strategies for dealing with this in the middle of the night? I don't want to feel this way - ever! It's been going on for a while now, certainly worse some nights than others. As I said at the beginning of my post, I know I'm not alone - but how do others out there cope?
I'd really been battling with night sweats and hot flushes until I decided to try my local acupuncturist. She was so lovely and gave me herbs in tablet form, and after two weeks I couldn't believe it, I had my sex drive back and no more hot flashes! I'm 49 and haven't had a period for 11 months and was so depressed I thought this was how it was going to be from now on. I finally feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep trying all options until you find what works for you!
I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
I'm pretty disheartened. I was trying to discuss a situation with him in a friendly manner (his new Country Club parking lot lights are very bright and directly shining into our house at night and I wanted to see if he could point them a little down or put on shields) and he gaslit me, mocked me, laughed at me, twisted my words, suggested I'm being unreasonable, and dismissed me with all of the tactics I'm very familiar with from men (and some women) throughout my life. I stayed very calm and polite throughout, I think.  Shields or pointing them down does not seem that hard to me, but he said the electric company has to do it and I should call them. Maybe that is true, even though it's on their property I don't know, but the way he handled the conversation was disturbing regardless.

I'm at a stage now where I can see it at least. I spent so many years not even seeing it and feeling crazy and ashamed. Now I see what he did and that it was cruel of him to speak to me that way but I still feel the same shame and fear and hopelessness. I'm posting here because this community is so supportive and I know many of you are like me and just feeling like you're not able or willing to take this treatment anymore. But I also know it's not the end of it for me or us. There will be more men, Drs, people who treat me like I'm subhuman. It really wears a person down. I'm pretty worn down with all this hormone stuff and being treated like I'm not worth even listening to or seeing. 

I really doubt he would have treated a man or person he saw as like him the same way. I was not dressed very well and I'm not very feminine and I'm overweight and I'm just wondering how much of these things played a role. Or is it just my lack of confidence or vibe or communication style even though I was calm and polite I don't know. But either way I don't treat people like that so I don't get it. I'd love to learn not to let it affect me but I'm not there yet, having only recently learned to see these tactics for what they are, and I still doubt myself and my sanity.  Anyway, solidarity to you all thanks for listening.
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. ðŸ™„

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
The two days immediately following my period, the absolute worst smell emanates from my body. It's so bad I don't want to socialize or go to work in the office. And after two days, it disappears without a trace. It's fishy, rancid, and strong. 
My gyn says it's normal and not to worry but this is just flat out gross.  Please tell me I don't have years and years of this to deal with. I'm on BCP because without it my hair falls out. 
There has to be a solution!
First of all, my sleep patterns are completely shot due to menopause and my phone. I'm working on better sleep hygiene and am pursuing HRT soon. I've noticed that lately, for reasons known only to god, when I wake up at night, a funny thought pops up and I get into a laughing fit. I'm under a lot of stress lately so maybe that has something to do with it but I think it's a hormone issue. Please tell me I'm not the only one!
What does menopausal bloat feel like to you?  Iâ€™m so bloated the last few days.  It comes and goes but sometimes I feel like I just ate at an all you can eat buffet.  I feel so full!!!!  Any tips to help me out?
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?

I'm wondering if anyone here changed to a plant-based diet in menopause to improve their quality of life.  If so, did your symptoms get worse, better, or was there no change?  And were all of your symptoms affected; i.e., hot flashes, mood changes, energy, etc. - or just one or two.  I'm just starting to read up on this type of diet, and most people say their energy level has greatly improved, but I haven't read anything yet about menopausal women.  Your experience?  Thank you.
Ok, so this is all anecdotal, but I'm looking for anyone to back me up with their experience as well so that I don't think I'm crazy.  I started using a sublingual NMN supplement a little over a week ago because an athletic nutritional supply company sent a newsletter saying it helped athletes over 40.  That's it, that's all it said.  Ok, I'll bite.  I'm always looking for ways to continue to do what I love to do, which is trail running and gravel biking, without getting injured.  So, after a week my dry eyes have gotten better, which means my tight jaw from constantly squinting is so much better.  I'm actually getting tired in the evenings around bedtime. (my circadian rhythm is back on track!) and a niggling knee injury is finally fading after staying the same level of hurting for the last two years.  I don't think this is a miracle supplement but I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences?
