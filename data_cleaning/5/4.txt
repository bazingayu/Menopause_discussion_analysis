**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!

5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**.

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment)

* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos

My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!

Has anyone tried Q-122 for treating severe hot flashes while taking cancer drugs such as Tamoxifen? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36366886/)
For those of you familiar with the original movie, what do you think would be happening in Riley's head 35-odd years later when perimenopause kicks in?
So as far as I (50f) can tell, I'm in perimenopause. My period just came 3 days late, and I'm on a retreat so missed the window of time to get my hormones tested this month. üôÑ

 I've never had hot flashes and my perimenopause is mostly characterized by "period flu" which may also be Long Covid relapses, itchy/dry skin, brain fog, insomnia, muscle pain and fatigue. I basically feel run down all the time. My PMDD and mutism (I'm autistic  with ADHD) and tendency to get overwhelmed are worse 1-3 weeks before my cycle.

Last night and this morning, after two nights of insomnia, I felt very hot suddenly but it started in my torso. I felt hotter and hotter, and dizzy and suddenly nauseated. It's like that sweaty feeling before you have to vomit. After I went to the bathroom, pooped,  felt better and then was chilled as well as exhausted.

My period started at 430AM today. This happened last night as well as about 2 hours after bleeding started.

I'm on a meditation retreat and had a similar thing happen at 5AM meditation in October, but I had had a flu shot the day before. I just looked at my period app and saw that that was the first day of my period too!

Back story: In December 2021 my psychiatrist prescribed me an antidepressant, venlafaxine. It numbed my feelings, but I had ALL the horrendous "side" effects, plus sudden dangerously high blood pressure that landed me in the cardiac ER, twice.

I'm still on blood pressure medications; before this drug my BP was normal. I'm a normal weight, don't smoke, and was very physically active until the antidepressant.

As soon as the withdrawal from that drug stopped, I got Covid, and was sick from Feb-Sept 2022. Then I got shingles. I now have some kind of chilblains or circulation problems in my toes and am almost always cold, so maybe was dressed too warmly?

I'm also in long term autistic; hoping to start back to work but I don't have disability status yet. Here in Germany they deny most petitions for it so I have a lawsuit against the state going. Without this, I am not sure if I can get any accommodations.

I've been sick and weak for over a year now.

Hormones definitely are making everything worse. But maybe these are a new PMDD thing? Or it is a blood pressure issue? Definitely feels like it did when my BP was in the danger zone.

I will see my gyno during my next period, whenever that is, and have appts scheduled with a circulation specialist as well as my regular physician.  But I've been running from doctor to doctor since Jan 2022 and I just want to lead a normal life again!

Plus which I'm on this retreat now for the next 6 days. If it's menstrual, then it'll probably stop. But I'm worried it's more serious.
Hey everyone, I M34, am really worried about my mom and her mental health. 

My dad seems to think she (59) has dementia after 6 months of a cognitive decline, forgetting things, words, rambling sentences, and most recently hating my dad for talking to her. They have been married 40 years and now she wants a break from him and for the past week has been going between complete silence and crying. 

Now - I am aware my dad can be a knobhead, so I was and am real hesitent to buy in to what he was saying about her going "crazy" - but my maternal aunt got a hold of me (I live in US, they are in the UK) and said there is something seriously up. 

She said she went to the doctor, but I am having a hard time buying that she did (said that she got a referral to a specialist, and the specialist called the next day and said she was fine and didnt need to be seen - that doesn't happen in reality with the NHS - or at least I don't think).

I'll be honest - I am very concerned she may have dementia, but talking with my nurse friend, she mentioned that there is a chance it could be related to the menopause. 

So I am just wondering if others have had a similar experience - and if there was any form of treatment for it? She is currently taking a short break in a local town with a friend, but when she comes back my aunt is going to try and convince her to go to the doctor with her. 

And sorry for the wall of text, I am just extremely worried about my mom, I am checking in with her every day, but I feel extremely helpless being in America and so far away, but I also have a baby and just started a new job, so I am not easily able to plan to go over there.

Edit: I just wanted to say a huge thank you for everyone who responded, this is an extremely sad and stressful time for me and I am just so worried about my mum, your answers have helped me write down an actual plan and I hoping for the best but prepared for the alternatives. You all are wonderful. Thank you.
Like fuckit, I'm gonna get on a bike and just wander around looking at flowers, and play with Legos, and read books just for fun, and have tea parties with random neighbors who I think are cool, and wear a crazy hat, stuff like that. 

And this time I'm gonna know how to really enjoy being a kid.
&lt;This is a throwaway account as my kids are on Reddit.&gt;

I had my first bout of prolonged bleeding as my period just didn‚Äôt seem to want to stop. For a while I had back-to-back UTIs, and that seemed better for months, but I‚Äôm afraid I have another one coming on. 
My skin is dry, horrible, and I‚Äôve got acne for days. My hair is thinning. I hate looking in the mirror. 
I‚Äôm beside myself with sadness. I don‚Äôt even know what to think or do anymore. This all just feels like it is hitting full force, and I can do nothing about it. 

How do I make perimenopause and these years more manageable? I don‚Äôt want to love like this.
So - I have a decently successful small business and I'm thinking about a BIG expansion. Something that would take me out of my home office/studio and into the world. Haven't really been out in the world for about 10 years now - meaning the vast majority of my days are spent either by myself or with only a few staff. I'm actually an introvert/extrovert cuspy type, but this prolonged work from home life means I am used to a quiet life.  


The expansion would mean some debt, but obviously I'd have a strong business plan so I don't think the risk will be huge, but it will mean relying on other people more (employees) and being outward facing. It will also mean a more fast-paced day, and probably a year or 2 of very intense work while I get more established.  
ANYWAY, I'm feeling like there's only so much time left in my productive life so want to make a move soon. But at the same time I am worried that when Menopause really hits I don't want to be embroiled in something life-altering. I'm 54 and have not missed a period yet, though have many perimenopausal symptoms. Maybe instead I should try to stay content with what's already good. Avoid stress. Have more fun?  


Is anyone else in this situation? I have a lot of ambitions but also don't want to overload myself in this super stressful time of life...
As the title says, Sinead O'Connor [had a breakdown and tried to commit suicide after she became surgically menopausal and her doctors refused to give her any hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O'Connor). I just ran across that piece of information recently and thought it was interesting. Just another example of women's hormonal concerns and needs being discounted, to potentially deadly effect.
My grandmother stayed home and looked after the grandkids complaining of hot flushes in her early 50s.  Could take a nap in the day when kids were in school, got thru it.

My mother had a part time job at a store where there was no pressure.  She had hot flushes and took some time off when she felt hormonal. Got thru it.

My time to go thru it, in a full time high pressured job with young kids as I had them later in life as advised by mother and grandparents,  with time off for any symptoms looking like weakness = a 5 year hell.  It's definitely harder for women nowadays.
Greetings. I'm new here, I'm 35 and I have always flushed and have rosacea. Lately, I've been looking more ruddy, and the flushes are becoming more frequent, and I'm going an intense red

My periods are only varying by a few days, but they used to be every 28 days like clockwork. I get PMDD symptoms, which i manage with agnus castus and acupuncture. The lines on my neck and chest have deepened. I have a little joint pain in my hips and I've been needing the toilet more urgently. No night sweats yet. I've ordered some sage following a search on this sub. 

Could I be in the very early stages of perimenopause?
I am about to turn 51 and got my first period around my 11th bday. I was on the pill for a few years in my 20s and pregnant twice in my 30s. Other than that, have been bleeding every 28 or so days for all these years, usually heavy and crampy too. Still no end in sight for me. Still needling every 28 days like clock work.  Holy hell Batman!
**Am I in peri/menopause? Is this the 'change'? How do I know? Should I be worried?**

These questions come up often in r/menopause and since we have a lot of new subscribers, we put together this quick reference guide to help narrow things down.

**Answer the following questions...**

1. Are you within the ages of 40-55? (Women even in their late 30's may notice some symptoms)  
2. Have periods become irregular? (heavier/lighter, further apart/closer together, different coloured blood, clots?)
3. Have you experienced other [symptoms](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)? (hint: not everyone experiences hot flashes)
4. Have you ruled out those symptoms as being due to something else? (like thyroid disease, other medical conditions, current medications, stress, lifestyle or environment changes?) It is *crucial* to get any new or consistent symptom checked out, as many peri/menopausal symptoms mimic other diseases/issues.
5. Have you had hormonal bloodwork indicating 'normal' levels, but yet you still feel like something is off?

**If you answered 'yes' to the above questions, then you can assume you are in perimenopause**. 

* However, not everyone experiences irregular periods as a first symptom. Even if periods are still regular but you notice other things (like bouts of uncontrolled anger/irritability, weepiness, inability to sleep, thinning hair, achy joints, vaginal dryness, sudden weight gain particularly around the middle, drop in libido, etc) then yes, you can still assume you are entering perimenopause. Irregular periods will come later.    

* There is no test to diagnose perimenopause.  Hormonal blood work only shows what your hormones were doing *on the day* the test was taken. Because hormones wildly fluctuate during peri, those levels will be very different the other 29 days of the month, therefore it's not an accurate diagnosing tool. For-profit organizations will insist on this test but most reputable medical professionals consider hormonal testing a scam and completely unnecessary.

**So how do I know?**  

* SYMPTOMS. If your symptoms have been ruled out as being due to something else, then those symptoms diagnose perimenopause.  This may mean you have to track things over time to see patterns and this is why perimenopause is often 'confirmed' in hindsight.  

* Family history does not predict how or when you will experience menopause.  

**Some common responses from doctors:**
&gt; You are too young to be in menopause!

&gt;It's anxiety/stress, here's a prescription for anti-depressants

&gt;Let's run hormonal tests to see if you're in menopause

&gt;Lose weight, exercise more

&gt;It's normal aging 

**Now that you think you are likely entering perimenopause...what now?**

* It's time to invest in yourself
* Read the [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index)

* Determine if symptoms are manageable (are they mild?, sometimes disruptive but okay? annoying? affecting your daily routine? ruining your quality of life?)
* Track symptoms - keep a diary/use an app, noting any new or unusual things that pop up.  Also keep track of any medications, supplements and/or vitamins. 
* Consider lifestyle changes (change diet, increase exercise, supplement vitamins, modify work environment) 
* Learn about menopause and what happens to our bodies without estrogen.  (See [Resources](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_resources) in the Menopause Wiki)
* Consider treatment options, whether that be OTC remedies or prescribed MHT/HRT, look at the scientific research. There are risks to everything, but arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to make informed decisions. 

**Finally** know that you are NOT alone, you are NOT crazy, and you do not have to suffer!  *We will get through this!*

Bads: covid 3 weeks ago, was visiting my younger sister, took the kids snow tubing, got back, sat down and said that I had fun and was so tired I didn't think I could move. She told me I should stop complaining and that I needed to "change my internal narrative."  I hope she knows whats coming to her! 

Goods: thought I had severe vaginal atrophy and was never going to orgasm again. Turns out it was vaginal eczema, treatable with a mild steroid, and I'm already so much better. Gyn said I have the vagina of a premenopausal woman! (I have eczema in lots of other places just didn't realize I could get it there but apparently skin is skin.)

Also just started progesterone. Surgical menopause at 42 and estrogen only for the past four years. Sleeping much better and constipation improving! Gotta thank you all for educating me on that one.

Edited my typos
I had my daughter at 43 and menopausal at 48.. last period at 47.  I‚Äôll be 51 in October.  I guess she may have been a perimenopause baby.. not sure . ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  

I sometimes get jealous of seeing younger women - 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs with their children in her first grade class.  They have no idea of how hard it‚Äôs been these past 3 years.  I sometimes wanna say just wait for it.  

Hair falling out and insomnia still occurring with an estrogen patch on and then throwing in the curveball of being a single mother!   ü§£ü§£

Thinking these women have it easier than me and wondering why I didn‚Äôt have children earlier..  dating now is an issue because I feel invisible to men. Invisible!  

 I try to do so much when I can with her and get fukking depressed when I‚Äôm too tired or sleep deprived to do anything but sit down after I pick her up from school.   

And she told her music teacher I was 50 and the teacher told her ‚Äú your mom is not 50‚Äù!
My metabolism has been screwy since I was prescribed Progesterone only a few years ago to deal with menopause symptoms. I think I've gain 50 pounds over the past 3 yrs. I need to deal with this weight gain, but I have also been dealing with insomnia for the same amount of time. I am exhausted all of the time and finding it really hard to get motivated enough to even go on a walk let alone get on the Peloton.  I just started estrogen/progesterone cream hoping that helps some with the sleep issues. What do you all do? In my 30s I was a runner &amp; triathlete - now I don't recognize myself physically or emotionally at all.
